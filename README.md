# Godot Sumi-e Shader Demo

This is an implementation of sumi-e (Chinese/East Asian painting) shader on Godot. To access the demo, open `src/Sumie.tscn`. The shader files are located in the assets folder. Basically, there are 2 shaders, a spatial shader to be applied to the meshes, and a post-processing shader to be applied to the final TextureRect node (named 'View' in the demo).
